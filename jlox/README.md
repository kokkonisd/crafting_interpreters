# jlox

A Java implementation of Lox.


## How to read this (sub)repo

This part of the repo contains the following elements:

- **src/**: the directory containing the source files needed to compile jlox. Note that
  some files, such as `Stmt.java` or `Expr.java` are automatically generated by
  metaprogramming tools (see **tools/** below).
- **tools/**: the directory containing metaprogramming tools used to generate
  boilerplate source files. One such example is files containing basic data-handling
  AST code, such as definitions of expression nodes.


## How to build/run jlox

Building and running jlox is done via the `Makefile`. Here are the supported targets:

- `make (all)`: only build jlox, with no additional steps. Building happens in several
  steps:
  1. Metaprogramming tools in `tools/` are compiled.
  2. Boilerplate source files are generated via the metaprogramming tools.
  3. The (now complete) list of source files is used to finally compile jlox.
- `make <example>.lox`: build jlox and run the interpreter on the example file.
- `make run`: build jlox and run the interpreter in interactive (REPL) mode.
